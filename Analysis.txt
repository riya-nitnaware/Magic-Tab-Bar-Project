Let’s create an Iconic Magic Tab Bar using HTML and CSS. This stylish tab navigation will feature smooth hover effects, glowing highlights, and a clean layout to make switching between sections look magical.

We’ll use:

HTML to structure the tab bar and icons.
CSS to style it with animations, hover effects, and glowing transitions.
This project is perfect for websites, portfolios, or apps where you want a unique and interactive navigation bar. The Magic Tab Bar combines simplicity with eye-catching effects to keep your design modern and engaging.
